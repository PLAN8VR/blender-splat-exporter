Autobake development.

Adding options to bake vertex colours on export, so that animated textures and lighting conditions can be baked into the vertex colours at export.

Choose diffuse, emmit, or combined (to include lighting conditions, shadows etc). Baking happens per frame at export.

Currently very unoptimised.
