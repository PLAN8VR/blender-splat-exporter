# blender-splat-exporter
Blender addon that exports synthetic Gaussian Splat .ply using Playcanvas' Splat-Transform. Currently works with vertex colours.
Addon also exports the .mjs file for future use with Splat Transform. 

Dependancy - https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform

Install Blender addon (blender_splat_export.py) the usual way.

Select mesh to export, file\export\Gaussian Splat (ply)

Ensure the mesh has colour attribute assigned and that vertex colours have been baked or created.
